## Requirements

- nodeJS v14.13.1
- React native
- expo CLI v4.10.1

## Install project

First we must verify that we have expo installed.

```bash
  expo -V
```

If we do not have it installed we will run the following command in the console.

```bash
  sudo npm install --global expo-cli
```

After installing expo CLI we will proceed to install all the necessary packages for the application.

```bash
  npm install
```

Then we can start the project with the following command.

```bash
  npm start
```


It is necessary to bear in mind that to be able to raise the simulators it is necessary to have installed Xcode for iSO and for android it is necessary to install andorid studio.
